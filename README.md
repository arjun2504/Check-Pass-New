CheckPass is a sample working prototype to show a new way of logging in an account or authorizing a task for an user.

This hub contains PHP files and an SQL file that contribute the prototype.

Photos have been seperated into numerous checkboxes and when the user clicks on each part of the picture, a checkbox clicks and the value of the check box will be taken as an authentication key.
